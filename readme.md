# Meetings Manager
Simple laravel application to learn from.

# Background
I had learnt laravel pretty quickly. Like in span of two days. But my problem was I had not made any working app even after that. I am more into learning things, that is what a full stack developer is meant to do. Hence, this was my first app once I got some time.
